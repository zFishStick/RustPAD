> **proof of work** - this repository mirrors verified contributions without exposing proprietary code

## what is this?

this repo was automatically generated by [**shōmei**](https://github.com/petarran/shomei) (証明, "proof" in Japanese), a tool that mirrors your work commits to your personal GitHub while keeping your company's IP safe.

### the story

i've been shipping code at `thesis-project`, but all those contributions were tied to my work email. my personal GitHub looked dead. recruiters thought i was on a permanent vacation. 

**shōmei** solved this by creating empty commits that match my work contribution timeline and my contribution graph now reflects reality.

## stats

- **13 commits** mirrored from my work repo
- **date range**: 2025-03-19 → 2025-10-02
- **zero code leaked** - only commit timestamps were used
- **fully automated** - generated in seconds

## why does this exist?

lots of developers use separate GitHubs for work. when you leave a company or just want to showcase your activity, your personal profile makes it look like you took years off. this is especially annoying when job hunting.

**shōmei** fixes this safely and ethically:
- no proprietary code is exposed
- no commit messages from work
- no file names or structure
- just timestamps proving you were actually working

## want to do this too?

check out [**shōmei**](https://github.com/petarran/shomei) - it's dead simple:

```bash
pip install shomei
cd ~/work/your-repo
shomei
```

that's it! your contribution graph will thank you!
